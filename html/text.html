<h2 id="css-text-properties">CSS Text Properties</h2>
<p>A HTML element may have one or more of a number of text properties (over and above its font properties):</p>
<ul>
<li>color - the colour of the text: [colour name, RGB value, HEX value];</li>
<li>text-align - the horizontal alignment: [left, center, right, justify];</li>
<li>text-decoration - one of [none, overline, line-through, underline];</li>
<li>text-transform - one of [uppercase, lowercase, capitalize];</li>
<li>text-indent - depth of indentation of the first line of text: [px, ...];</li>
<li>text-shadow - horizontal and vertical position (positive means up and right) and colour;</li>
<li>letter-spacing - extra space between characters (negative means less): [px ...];</li>
<li>word-spacing - extra space between words (negative means less): [px ...];</li>
<li><p>line-height - the space between lines: (e.g. 2.0, 0.75);</p></li>
<li>vertical-align - set the vertical alignment of an element; there are quite a few choices;</li>
<li><p>white-space - specifies how white-space inside an element is handled;</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The default colour for text is that of the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element.</p>
<p>For proper W3C compliant CSS, the background-color should also be defined whenever the color property is defined.</p>
<p>Note: <code>text-decoration=none</code> is used to stop links being underlined.</p>
<p>There are also the properties <code>unicode-bidi</code> and <code>direction</code> that have something to do with overriding the text direction in documents that contain quotes in different writing systems.</p>

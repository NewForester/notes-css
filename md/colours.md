# CSS3

## CSS Colours

There are three ways colours may be specified:

  * by name             - eg: `"red"`
  * by RGB value        - eg: `"rgb(255,0,0)"`
  * by HEX value        - eg: `"#ff0000"`

Colour names are case insensitive as are hex values.
CSS and HTML support 140 named colours.
RGB and HEX are 24-bit values giving a very large number of shades.

An RGB value gives a figure between 0 and 255 for each of the three primary colours red, green and blue.

No colour is 0, full colour is 255.

This gives rgb(0,0,0) for black and rgb(255,255,255) for white.

Shades of grey have the same value for all three colours.

A hex value is similar to RGB: #RRGGBB with the colour values falling the range 0 to ff.

CSS3 adds HSL and RGBa colours.
These will be covered later.

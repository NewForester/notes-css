# CSS3

These notes were made while learning CSS using the CSS and CSS3 Tutorials provided on-line by w3shools.com.
Their material is "All Rights Reserved".

There are 37 'chapters' in the CSS tutorial and a further 22 in the CSS3 tutorial.
This suggests CSS is much bigger than HTML.

The tutorial has:

  * examples in each 'chapter';
  * an examples section (are these not a repetition ?);
  * a templates section with free (to use and modify) 'responsive' page layouts;
  * an exercises and quiz section (I thought these were a repetition of those in the 'chapters');
  * a reference section (with 8 chapters);
  * an diploma exam (that yields a W3Schools Online Certification);

## Introduction

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a notation for describing styles for the elements of HTML documents.
Styles describe how the elements should be presented on screen, print or other media.

HTML was created to describe the contents of web pages, not how to display them.
Tags such as `<font>` and `<color>` where added in HTML 3.2.

However, font and color attributes had to be added by hand to every element of every page.
The development and maintenance of large web sites became a long an expensive process.
To solve this problem, the W3C defined CSS.

CSS allows web developers to remove style formatting from HTML pages and placed it in external files called style sheets.
Each style sheet can be included in many web pages.
This generally saves a lot of work if you respect the DRY principle.

CSS can be used to define styles with variations for different devices and screen sizes.

## CSS3 Modules

CSS3 is the latest standard for CSS.
It is backwards compatible with earlier versions of CSS.

The specification has been split into modules.
Some modules are new but others comprise parts of the old specification with enhancements.
Modern browsers implement most of the new specification.

The most important CSS3 modules are:

  * selectors;
  * box model;
  * backgrounds and borders;
  * image values and replaced content;
  * text effects;
  * 2D and 3D transformations;
  * animations;
  * multiple column layout;
  * user interface;

<p>The display property is an an important property for controlling output.</p>
<p>HTML elements are either block or span and their default display property values are <code>block</code> and <code>inline</code> respectively. The latter can be overridden.</p>
<p>An example of overriding the display property for a block element would be:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode html"><code class="sourceCode html">    li {
      display: inline;
    }</code></pre>
<p>This would list items across, rather than down, the page. It is often used to create menu bars.</p>
<p>An example of overriding property for a span element would be:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode html"><code class="sourceCode html">    a {
      display: block;
    }</code></pre>
<p>This would display links down, rather than across, the page. This has the effect of creating a list of links to chose from.</p>
<hr /><!-- Hiding elements -->

<p>An element can be 'removed' from the display by setting its <code>display</code> property to <code>none</code>. This is used in scripts to hide and reveal elements rather than delete and re-create them.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode html"><code class="sourceCode html">    #peek-a-boo {
      display: none;
    }</code></pre>
<p>An alternative is the <code>visibility</code> property. When set to <code>hidden</code>, an element is not displayed but the space it occupies remains reserved.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode html"><code class="sourceCode html">    #big-empty-space {
      visibility: hidden;
    }</code></pre>
</body>

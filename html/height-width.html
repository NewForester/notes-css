<h2 id="css-height-and-width">CSS Height and Width</h2>
<p>The dimensions of an HTML elements are affected by six properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>height and width - absolute size</li>
<li>max_height and max_width - maximum size</li>
<li>min_height and min_width - minimum size</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, the values of the <code>height</code> and <code>width</code> properties is <code>auto</code>, which means the browser calculates them. The min and max forms limit the browser's calculations.</p>
<p>The dimensions are for the element. They do not include padding, border or margins but refer to the area inside these.</p>
<p>The dimensions may be specified in [px, cm, ...] or as a % of the enclosing element's dimensions.</p>
<p>When absolute dimensions are used, the browser will create scroll bars when the display area is not big enough. This is particularly noticeable on small screens.</p>
<p>Maximum dimensions override absolute dimensions and lead to fewer scroll bars issues.</p>

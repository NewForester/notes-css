## CSS Box Model

HTML elements may be thought of as nested boxes:

  * the content is the inner most box
  * around this is the padding
  * around this is the border
  * around this is the margin

The box model allows not only borders around elements but the adjustment of the space between elements.

The full height and width of an element is the sum of the heights and widths of all four boxes:

  * height = element height + top (padding + border + margin) + bottom (padding + border + margin)
  * width = element width + left (padding + border + margin) + right (padding + border + margin)

I guess this is so important it cannot be intuitive and so warranted deliberate emphasis.

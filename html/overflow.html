<h2 id="css-overflow">CSS Overflow</h2>
<p>The <code>overflow</code> property specifies whether to clip content or to add scrollbars when the contents of an element exceed its width or height.</p>
<p>The overflow property is only relevant when width or height properties are specified as otherwise the browser calculates the width and/or height such that the element's box is sufficient to contain its contents.</p>
<p>Text may wrap so vertical overflow may appear to be of more interest but, with images and more complex content, horizontal overflow may be more important.</p>
<p>The overflow property may take one of four values:</p>
<ul>
<li>visible - overflow is not clipped but is renders outside the element's box (default);</li>
<li>hidden - overflow is clipped and the clipped content is invisible;</li>
<li>scroll - scrollbars are added so all content may be seen by scrolling;</li>
<li>auto - scrollbars area added only when necessary.</li>
</ul>
<p>With <code>overflow=scroll</code> vertical and horizontal scrollbars are added even when not needed.</p>
<p>With <code>overflow=auto</code> vertical and horizontal scrollbars are added only as needed.</p>
<p>The <code>overflow-x</code> and <code>overflow-y</code> properties provide greater control over how overflow is handled. They do not affect when overflow occurs in either dimension.</p>

# CSS Notes

There are notes made while studying the CSS Tutorial at [W3C Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/).

---

These notes contain CSS and HTML examples.
To simplify the task of writing and re-reading the notes,
they were written in MarkDown syntax and then converted to HTML.

The original MarkDown and the converted HTML files are committed under the subdirectories `md` and `html` respectively.
